# ERC-6909 and Uniswap V4

## Overview

ERC-6909 is a minimal and gas-efficient standard for managing multiple token types within a single contract. It provides a simplified alternative to the more complex ERC-1155 multi-token standard. Uniswap V4 utilizes ERC-6909 to implement claim tokens, which represent user balances within the protocol.

## ERC-6909 vs ERC-1155

ERC-6909 offers several advantages over ERC-1155:

1. Simplified interface: ERC-6909 removes unnecessary callbacks and batching constraints present in ERC-1155.
2. Improved transfer delegation: ERC-6909 provides a more efficient system for transfer delegation.
3. Gas efficiency: ERC-6909 reduces gas costs for deployment, transfers, and burning operations.
4. Reduced code size: Implementing ERC-6909 results in smaller contract sizes compared to ERC-1155.

However, it's worth noting that ERC-6909 does introduce a total supply variable, which leads to an additional disk write on mint and burn operations.

## Integration with Uniswap V4

Uniswap V4 leverages ERC-6909 for both inbound and outbound tokens across all lifecycle operations, including swaps, liquidity provision, and donations. The use of ERC-6909 in Uniswap V4 offers several benefits:

1. Internal balance accounting: By using ERC-6909, Uniswap V4 can manage token balances internally without making external calls to token contract addresses (e.g., USDC or USDT). This approach significantly reduces gas costs and improves overall efficiency.

2. Enhanced performance for specific users: The gas savings and improved efficiency are particularly beneficial for:
   - MEV bots
   - High-frequency traders
   - Active liquidity managers

3. Streamlined operations: ERC-6909 allows for more efficient handling of multi-token accounting within the protocol, simplifying various processes and reducing complexity.

By utilizing the ERC-6909 standard, Uniswap V4 achieves a gas-efficient and streamlined approach to managing multiple token types within the protocol. This implementation enables faster, cheaper operations while maintaining the flexibility required for a diverse range of trading and liquidity provision activities.
